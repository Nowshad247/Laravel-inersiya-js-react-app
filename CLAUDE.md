# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Skills Development Center Portal — a Laravel + Inertia (React) admin portal for managing a course/training center: students, courses, batches, leads, billing/invoicing, certificate verification, and role-based user administration.

## Commands

### Environment / dev servers
- `composer run dev` — runs the full dev stack concurrently: `php artisan serve`, `php artisan queue:listen`, `php artisan pail` (logs), and `npm run dev` (Vite).
- `composer run dev:ssr` — same, but builds and serves the Inertia SSR bundle instead of Vite dev mode.
- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server only (frontend).
- `npm run build` / `npm run build:ssr` — production frontend build (SSR variant also builds `resources/js/ssr.tsx`).

### Backend (PHP)
- `composer test` (or `php artisan test`) — run the full Pest/PHPUnit suite; clears config cache first.
- `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/SomeTest.php` — run a single test file.
- `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName` — run tests matching a name (preferred after touching a specific feature).
- `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` — format only changed PHP files to match project style (run before finalizing PHP changes; do not use `pint --test`).
- `php artisan migrate` — run migrations against the currently active connection (see Multi-database section below). `php run-migrations.php` is a standalone safe migration runner used in some deploy scripts.
- `php artisan db:seed` — seeds via `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php`, which calls `RolePermissionSeeder`, `UserSeeder`, and lead-related seeders in order.

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)
- `npm run lint` — ESLint with `--fix`.
- `npm run format` / `npm run format:check` — Prettier over `resources/`.
- `npm run types` — `tsc --noEmit` type check.

## Architecture

### Stack
Laravel 12 (streamlined structure — middleware registered in `bootstrap/app.php`, not `Http/Kernel.php`) + Inertia.js v2 + React 19 + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Vite, Pest v4 for tests, `spatie/laravel-permission` for roles/permissions, Laravel Fortify for auth, and Laravel Wayfinder for typed route/controller bindings on the frontend.

### Request flow: routes → controllers → Inertia pages
- All web routes live in a single `routes/web.php`. Authenticated routes sit inside one `Route::middleware(['auth', 'verified'])->group(...)` block; almost every route additionally carries a `->middleware('permission:<name>')` guard from `spatie/laravel-permission` (aliased as `permission` in `bootstrap/app.php`, alongside `role`).
- Controllers return `Inertia::render('some/page')`, where the string maps to a file under `resources/js/pages/some/page.tsx`. There are no Blade views for the app UI — `resources/views/app.blade.php` is just the Inertia root template.
- Routes are grouped by feature with comments (`//Billing Routes`, `//Lead Routes`, etc.) rather than route-group prefixes/controllers — follow this comment-block convention when adding a new feature area, and place new routes near their sibling feature block.

### Permissions (Spatie)
- Permission names follow `<verb>_<resource>` snake_case (e.g. `view_billing`, `create_students`, `edit_roles`). Roles are seeded in `database/seeders/RolePermissionSeeder.php`: `admin` gets `Permission::all()`; other roles (`user`, `student`, `teacher`, `accounts`, `editor`) get explicit subsets.
- Permissions are created with `Permission::firstOrCreate` (idempotent), but roles use `Role::create` (NOT idempotent — assumes a fresh database). When adding new permissions to an already-seeded environment, don't just edit the seeder and re-run `db:seed`; create the permission(s) directly and attach to the relevant role(s) (e.g. via `php artisan tinker`), in addition to updating the seeder for future fresh installs.
- `HandleInertiaRequests` (`app/Http/Middleware/HandleInertiaRequests.php`) shares `auth.user` and `auth.permissions` (flat array of permission name strings from `getAllPermissions()`) on every Inertia response.
- On the frontend, `NavItem` (`resources/js/types/index.d.ts`) has an optional `permission` field and both `mainNavItems`/`footerNavItems` in `resources/js/components/app-sidebar.tsx` set it for gated items — but note `NavMain`/`NavFooter` currently render unconditionally and don't actually filter by this field; access control is enforced server-side by the route's `permission:` middleware, not by hiding the link.

### Multi-database switching
- The app can run against one of two live MySQL connections, `mysql_primary` or `mysql_secondary` (defined in `config/database.php`, credentials via `DB_*` / `DB_*_2` env vars). `app/Services/DatabaseSwitcher.php` stores the active connection name in cache (`active_database_connection`, ~1 year TTL) and the `SetActiveDatabase` middleware (registered globally in `bootstrap/app.php`) applies it as `database.default` on every web request. `App\Http\Controllers\Admin\DatabaseSwitchController` lets an admin switch which database is active at runtime. Keep this in mind when debugging "missing data" — check which connection is currently active before assuming a migration/seed issue.

### Frontend structure (`resources/js/`)
- `pages/` — Inertia page components, one directory per feature (e.g. `billings/`, `student/`), matching the string passed to `Inertia::render()`.
- `components/` — shared React components; `components/ui/` holds shadcn/Radix-based primitives (Card, Sidebar, etc.) — reuse these instead of introducing new UI primitives.
- `layouts/` — page shells; `app-layout.tsx` (sidebar layout, used by nearly all authenticated pages) wraps `layouts/app/app-sidebar-layout.tsx`. `AppLayout` takes a `breadcrumbs: BreadcrumbItem[]` prop that most pages pass in.
- `components/app-sidebar.tsx` — the single source of truth for the sidebar nav: `mainNavItems` (top nav) and `footerNavItems` (bottom-pinned nav, e.g. Billings/Leads/Verify Certificate). Add new top-level nav entries here.
- `routes/`, `actions/`, `wayfinder/` — auto-generated by the `@laravel/vite-plugin-wayfinder` Vite plugin from PHP routes/controllers; don't hand-edit, they regenerate on `npm run dev`/`build` (or `php artisan wayfinder:generate` if the Vite plugin isn't running). Not every page uses these generated helpers — several existing pages (e.g. billing/sidebar links) just use plain string hrefs like `/billings`; follow whichever convention the sibling code you're touching already uses.
- `types/index.d.ts` — shared TS interfaces (`NavItem`, `User`, `Role`, `Permission`, `SharedData`, etc.) for Inertia shared props and nav config.

### Domain model
Core Eloquent models live flat in `app/Models/`: `Student`, `Course`, `Batch`/`BatchDetail`, `Admission`, `Lead` (+ `LeadCall`, `LeadNote`, `LeadProfile`, `LeadReminder`, `LeadSource`, `LeadStatus`), and a billing cluster — `Invoice`/`InvoiceItem`, `Payment`, `PaymentMethod`, `InstallmentPlan`/`InstallmentSchedule`, `Discount`, `CourseFeeRule`, `BillingAccount`, `Ledger`, `Receipt`, `Refund`. `User` uses `spatie/laravel-permission`'s roles/permissions traits.

### Testing
- Pest is configured (`tests/Pest.php`) to bind `Tests\TestCase` and `RefreshDatabase` for everything under `tests/Feature`. Tests use `:memory:` SQLite (see `phpunit.xml`), independent of the dual-MySQL setup used at runtime.
- Existing tests assume an authenticated user needs the `admin` role for settings-type endpoints (see `tests/Feature/SiteSettingsUpdateTest.php`'s `adminUser()` helper pattern: `User::factory()->create()` then `assignRole(Role::findOrCreate('admin', 'web'))`) — reuse this pattern rather than assuming a bare factory user has access.

## Laravel Boost

This project has Laravel Boost installed (MCP server + generated guidelines below). If Boost's MCP tools (`search-docs`, `tinker`, `database-query`, `browser-logs`, `list-artisan-commands`, `get-absolute-url`) are available in your tool list, prefer them per the guidelines — in particular, use `search-docs` before implementing anything touching Laravel/Inertia/Wayfinder/Tailwind/Pest, since it returns version-pinned docs for the exact package versions this repo uses.

<laravel-boost-guidelines>
=== foundation rules ===

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to enhance the user's satisfaction building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context
This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.5.0
- inertiajs/inertia-laravel (INERTIA) - v2
- laravel/fortify (FORTIFY) - v1
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- laravel/wayfinder (WAYFINDER) - v0
- tightenco/ziggy (ZIGGY) - v2
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- pestphp/pest (PEST) - v4
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v12
- @inertiajs/react (INERTIA) - v2
- react (REACT) - v19
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v4
- @laravel/vite-plugin-wayfinder (WAYFINDER) - v0
- eslint (ESLINT) - v9
- prettier (PRETTIER) - v3

## Conventions
- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts
- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove it works. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture
- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling
- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Replies
- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

## Documentation Files
- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

=== boost rules ===

## Laravel Boost
- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan
- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs
- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging
- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool
- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)
- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before any other approaches when dealing with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- The `search-docs` tool is perfect for all Laravel-related packages, including Laravel, Inertia, Livewire, Filament, Tailwind, Pest, Nova, Nightwatch, etc.
- You must use this tool to search for Laravel ecosystem documentation before falling back to other approaches.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries to start. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax
- You can and should pass multiple queries at once. The most relevant results will be returned first.

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

## PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even if it has one line.

### Constructors
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

### Type Declarations
- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Comments
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless there is something very complex going on.

## PHPDoc Blocks
- Add useful array shape type definitions for arrays when appropriate.

## Enums
- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

=== tests rules ===

## Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

## Inertia

- Inertia.js components should be placed in the `resources/js/pages` directory unless specified differently in the JS bundler (`vite.config.js`).
- Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of traditional Blade views.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for accurate guidance on all things Inertia.

<code-snippet name="Inertia Render Example" lang="php">
// routes/web.php example
Route::get('/users', function () {
    return Inertia::render('Users/Index', [
        'users' => User::all()
    ]);
});
</code-snippet>

=== inertia-laravel/v2 rules ===

## Inertia v2

- Make use of all Inertia features from v1 and v2. Check the documentation before making any changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.

### Inertia v2 New Features
- Deferred props.
- Infinite scrolling using merging props and `WhenVisible`.
- Lazy loading data on scroll.
- Polling.
- Prefetching.

### Deferred Props & Empty States
- When using deferred props on the frontend, you should add a nice empty state with pulsing/animated skeleton.

### Inertia Form General Guidance
- The recommended way to build forms when using Inertia is with the `<Form>` component - a useful example is below. Use the `search-docs` tool with a query of `form component` for guidance.
- Forms can also be built using the `useForm` helper for more programmatic control, or to follow existing conventions. Use the `search-docs` tool with a query of `useForm helper` for guidance.
- `resetOnError`, `resetOnSuccess`, and `setDefaultsOnSuccess` are available on the `<Form>` component. Use the `search-docs` tool with a query of `form component resetting` for guidance.

=== laravel/core rules ===

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Database
- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation
- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources
- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

### Controllers & Validation
- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

### Queues
- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

### URL Generation
- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Configuration
- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

### Testing
- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

### Vite Error
- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

## Laravel 12

- Use the `search-docs` tool to get version-specific documentation.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

### Laravel 12 Structure
- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app\Console\Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

### Database
- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models
- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== wayfinder/core rules ===

## Laravel Wayfinder

Wayfinder generates TypeScript functions and types for Laravel controllers and routes which you can import into your client-side code. It provides type safety and automatic synchronization between backend routes and frontend code.

### Development Guidelines
- Always use the `search-docs` tool to check Wayfinder correct usage before implementing any features.
- Always prefer named imports for tree-shaking (e.g., `import { show } from '@/actions/...'`).
- Avoid default controller imports (prevents tree-shaking).
- Run `php artisan wayfinder:generate` after route changes if Vite plugin isn't installed.

### Feature Overview
- Form Support: Use `.form()` with `--with-form` flag for HTML form attributes — `<form {...store.form()}>` → `action="/posts" method="post"`.
- HTTP Methods: Call `.get()`, `.post()`, `.patch()`, `.put()`, `.delete()` for specific methods — `show.head(1)` → `{ url: "/posts/1", method: "head" }`.
- Invokable Controllers: Import and invoke directly as functions. For example, `import StorePost from '@/actions/.../StorePostController'; StorePost()`.
- Named Routes: Import from `@/routes/` for non-controller routes. For example, `import { show } from '@/routes/post'; show(1)` for route name `post.show`.
- Parameter Binding: Detects route keys (e.g., `{post:slug}`) and accepts matching object properties — `show("my-post")` or `show({ slug: "my-post" })`.
- Query Merging: Use `mergeQuery` to merge with `window.location.search`, set values to `null` to remove — `show(1, { mergeQuery: { page: 2, sort: null } })`.
- Query Parameters: Pass `{ query: {...} }` in options to append params — `show(1, { query: { page: 1 } })` → `"/posts/1?page=1"`.
- Route Objects: Functions return `{ url, method }` shaped objects — `show(1)` → `{ url: "/posts/1", method: "get" }`.
- URL Extraction: Use `.url()` to get URL string — `show.url(1)` → `"/posts/1"`.

### Example Usage

<code-snippet name="Wayfinder Basic Usage" lang="typescript">
    // Import controller methods (tree-shakable)...
    import { show, store, update } from '@/actions/App/Http/Controllers/PostController'

    // Get route object with URL and method...
    show(1) // { url: "/posts/1", method: "get" }

    // Get just the URL...
    show.url(1) // "/posts/1"

    // Use specific HTTP methods...
    show.get(1) // { url: "/posts/1", method: "get" }
    show.head(1) // { url: "/posts/1", method: "head" }

    // Import named routes...
    import { show as postShow } from '@/routes/post' // For route name 'post.show'
    postShow(1) // { url: "/posts/1", method: "get" }
</code-snippet>

### Wayfinder + Inertia
If your application uses the `<Form>` component from Inertia, you can use Wayfinder to generate form action and method automatically.
<code-snippet name="Wayfinder Form Component (React)" lang="typescript">

<Form {...store.form()}><input name="title" /></Form>

</code-snippet>

=== pint/core rules ===

## Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest
### Testing
- If you need to verify a feature is working, write or update a Unit / Feature test.

### Pest Tests
- All tests must be written using Pest. Use `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files - these are core to the application.
- Tests should test all of the happy paths, failure paths, and weird paths.
- Tests live in the `tests/Feature` and `tests/Unit` directories.
- Pest tests look and behave like this:
<code-snippet name="Basic Pest Test Example" lang="php">
it('is true', function () {
    expect(true)->toBeTrue();
});
</code-snippet>

### Running Tests
- Run the minimal number of tests using an appropriate filter before finalizing code edits.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test --compact`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).
- When the tests relating to your changes are passing, ask the user if they would like to run the entire test suite to ensure everything is still passing.

### Pest Assertions
- When asserting status codes on a response, use the specific method like `assertForbidden` and `assertNotFound` instead of using `assertStatus(403)` or similar, e.g.:
<code-snippet name="Pest Example Asserting postJson Response" lang="php">
it('returns all', function () {
    $response = $this->postJson('/api/docs', []);

    $response->assertSuccessful();
});
</code-snippet>

### Mocking
- Mocking can be very helpful when appropriate.
- When mocking, you can use the `Pest\Laravel\mock` Pest function, but always import it via `use function Pest\Laravel\mock;` before using it. Alternatively, you can use `$this->mock()` if existing tests do.
- You can also create partial mocks using the same import or self method.

### Datasets
- Use datasets in Pest to simplify tests that have a lot of duplicated data. This is often the case when testing validation rules, so consider this solution when writing tests for validation rules.

<code-snippet name="Pest Dataset Example" lang="php">
it('has emails', function (string $email) {
    expect($email)->not->toBeEmpty();
})->with([
    'james' => 'james@laravel.com',
    'taylor' => 'taylor@laravel.com',
]);
</code-snippet>

=== pest/v4 rules ===

## Pest 4

- Pest 4 is a huge upgrade to Pest and offers: browser testing, smoke testing, visual regression testing, test sharding, and faster type coverage.
- Browser testing is incredibly powerful and useful for this project.
- Browser tests should live in `tests/Browser/`.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for detailed guidance on utilizing these features.

### Browser Testing
- You can use Laravel features like `Event::fake()`, `assertAuthenticated()`, and model factories within Pest 4 browser tests, as well as `RefreshDatabase` (when needed) to ensure a clean state for each test.
- Interact with the page (click, type, scroll, select, submit, drag-and-drop, touch gestures, etc.) when appropriate to complete the test.
- If requested, test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- If requested, test on different devices and viewports (like iPhone 14 Pro, tablets, or custom breakpoints).
- Switch color schemes (light/dark mode) when appropriate.
- Take screenshots or pause tests for debugging when appropriate.

### Example Tests

<code-snippet name="Pest Browser Test Example" lang="php">
it('may reset the password', function () {
    Notification::fake();

    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create());

    $page = visit('/sign-in'); // Visit on a real browser...

    $page->assertSee('Sign In')
        ->assertNoJavascriptErrors() // or ->assertNoConsoleLogs()
        ->click('Forgot Password?')
        ->fill('email', 'nuno@laravel.com')
        ->click('Send Reset Link')
        ->assertSee('We have emailed your password reset link!')

    Notification::assertSent(ResetPassword::class);
});
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Pest Smoke Testing Example" lang="php">
$pages = visit(['/', '/about', '/contact']);

$pages->assertNoJavascriptErrors()->assertNoConsoleLogs();
</code-snippet>

=== inertia-react/core rules ===

## Inertia + React

- Use `router.visit()` or `<Link>` for navigation instead of traditional links.

<code-snippet name="Inertia Client Navigation" lang="react">

import { Link } from '@inertiajs/react'
<Link href="/">Home</Link>

</code-snippet>

=== inertia-react/v2/forms rules ===

## Inertia v2 + React Forms

<code-snippet name="`<Form>` Component Example" lang="react">

import { Form } from '@inertiajs/react'

export default () => (
    <Form action="/users" method="post">
        {({
            errors,
            hasErrors,
            processing,
            wasSuccessful,
            recentlySuccessful,
            clearErrors,
            resetAndClearErrors,
            defaults
        }) => (
        <>
        <input type="text" name="name" />

        {errors.name && <div>{errors.name}</div>}

        <button type="submit" disabled={processing}>
            {processing ? 'Creating...' : 'Create User'}
        </button>

        {wasSuccessful && <div>User created successfully!</div>}
        </>
    )}
    </Form>
)

</code-snippet>

=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

## Tailwind CSS

- Use Tailwind CSS classes to style HTML; check and use existing Tailwind conventions within the project before writing your own.
- Offer to extract repeated patterns into components that match the project's conventions (i.e. Blade, JSX, Vue, etc.).
- Think through class placement, order, priority, and defaults. Remove redundant classes, add classes to parent or child carefully to limit repetition, and group elements logically.
- You can use the `search-docs` tool to get exact examples from the official documentation when needed.

### Spacing
- When listing items, use gap utilities for spacing; don't use margins.

<code-snippet name="Valid Flex Gap Spacing Example" lang="html">
    <div class="flex gap-8">
        <div>Superior</div>
        <div>Michigan</div>
        <div>Erie</div>
    </div>
</code-snippet>

### Dark Mode
- If existing pages and components support dark mode, new pages and components must support dark mode in a similar way, typically using `dark:`.

=== tailwindcss/v4 rules ===

## Tailwind CSS 4

- Always use Tailwind CSS v4; do not use the deprecated utilities.
- `corePlugins` is not supported in Tailwind v4.
- In Tailwind v4, configuration is CSS-first using the `@theme` directive — no separate `tailwind.config.js` file is needed.

<code-snippet name="Extending Theme in CSS" lang="css">
@theme {
  --color-brand: oklch(0.72 0.11 178);
}
</code-snippet>

- In Tailwind v4, you import Tailwind using a regular CSS `@import` statement, not using the `@tailwind` directives used in v3:

<code-snippet name="Tailwind v4 Import Tailwind Diff" lang="diff">
   - @tailwind base;
   - @tailwind components;
   - @tailwind utilities;
   + @import "tailwindcss";
</code-snippet>

### Replaced Utilities
- Tailwind v4 removed deprecated utilities. Do not use the deprecated option; use the replacement.
- Opacity values are still numeric.

| bg-opacity-* | bg-black/* |
| text-opacity-* | text-black/* |
| border-opacity-* | border-black/* |
| divide-opacity-* | divide-black/* |
